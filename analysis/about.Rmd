I am a third-year postdoctoral oncology fellow at the University of Chicago. I work in the Olopade and Im labs. My overall research interest is in the interaction between germline and somatic mutations in tumors and how the interaction between these two genetic / transcriptomic states affects tumor heterogeneity and evolution.
