This is the site I will use for a project in which I am assessing differential expression between a population of Nigerian breast cancer patients and breast cancer patients from the TCGA. 

Workflow and analysis published here: 

#Protocols
* *Alignment*: STAR (completed prior to analysis by Dominic Fitzgerald), initial steps of 
[PsychENCODE pipeline]: (https://gist.github.com/djf604/a3d6925c3775d6cf1053ded0e7a8b148)

* *Raw read counts*: HTSeq (completed prior to analysis by Dominic Fitzgerald)

* *Differential expression*: Limma-voom w/ quantile normalization

#Differential expression:
Initial processsing results:
Nigerian lincRNA: 236737 reads, TCGA: 120498 reads
Nigerian protein coding: 1647444 reads, TCGA 1322765 reads
Nigerian pseudogene: 302306 reads, TCGA: 184049 reads

Nigerians: Not aligned: 233461517
TCGA: Not aligned: 1725472254 (this is expected) 

* Batch effect correction exploration:

* Differential expression analysis (protein coding genes only) using samples with whole genome sequencing available: https://parajago.github.io/TCGA-Nigerian-RNAseq/NigerianTCGArawcountsDeSeq2-proteincoding-IHC.html
