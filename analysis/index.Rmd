This is the site I will use for a project in which I am assessing differential expression between a population of Nigerian breast cancer patients and breast cancer patients from the TCGA. 

Workflow and analysis published here: 

#Protocols
* *Alignment*: STAR (completed prior to analysis by Dominic Fitzgerald), initial steps of 
[PsychENCODE pipeline]: (https://gist.github.com/djf604/a3d6925c3775d6cf1053ded0e7a8b148)

* *Raw read counts*: HTSeq (completed prior to analysis by Dominic Fitzgerald)

* *Differential expression*: DESeq2

#Differential expression:

Initial processsing results:
Nigerian lincRNA: 236737 reads, TCGA: 120498 reads
Nigerian protein coding: 1647444 reads, TCGA 1322765 reads
Nigerian pseudogene: 302306 reads, TCGA: 184049 reads

Nigerians: Not aligned: 233461517
TCGA: Not aligned: 1725472254 (this is expected) 

* Differential expression QC and analysis (all genes): https://parajago.github.io/TCGA-Nigerian-RNAseq/NigerianTCGArawcountsDeSeq2.html
* Differential expression QC and analysis (protein coding genes only): https://parajago.github.io/TCGA-Nigerian-RNAseq/NigerianTCGArawcountsDeSeq2-proteincoding.html

#Pending analyses
* Pre-analysis visual summarization: TSNE, UMAP

* Differential expression of: candidate driver genes
* Verification in whole-genome sequencing samples only

* Check 14q loss across the groups
* Plan for pathway analysis/GSEA
